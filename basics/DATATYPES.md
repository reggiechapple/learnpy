# Data Types in Python

## Numbers
Numbers in Python must start with a number digit, (0-9); a dot (period), which is decimal; or a hypen (-) used as a negative sign for negative numbers

| Number         | Okay?           | Reason                                                               |
| ---------------|:---------------:| --------------------------------------------------------------------:|
| 1              | Good            | A whole number (integer)                                             |
| 1.1            | Good            | A number with a decimal point                                        |
| 1234567.89     | Good            | A large number with a decimal point and no comma                     |
| -2             | Good            | A negative number, as indicated by the starting hypen                |
| .99            | Good            | A number that starts with a decimal point because it's less than one |

### *Integers*
An integer is any whole number, positive or negative. There is no limit to its size. Numbers like 0, -1, and 999999999 are all perfectly valid integers. From your perspective, an integer is just any valid number that doesn't contain a decimal point.
