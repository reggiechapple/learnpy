# Variables
A *variable* is simply a placeholder for information that may vary (change).
The naming rules for Python *varibales* are:
* The variable name ust start with a letter or underscore (_).
* After the first letter you can use letters, numbers, or underscores.
* Variable names are case-sensitive, so once you make up a name, any other reference to that variable must use the same uppercase and lowercase letters as the name you originally made up.
* Variable names cannot be enclosed in, or contain, single or double quotation marks.
* PEP 8 style conventions recommend using only lowercase letters in variable names, use an underscore to separate multiple words in the variable name.
